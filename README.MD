## Login/Signup features
The `Authentication` system, including sign-up and login features, was developed using Firebase Authentication. The system also has requirements when it comes to validity of user's email and password including: correct email format, password has to be longer than 6 characters, no duplicate users or email allowed, etc.

`Login` session will also be saved. Meaning once a user log in, even after closing the app, the user will still stay logging in.
